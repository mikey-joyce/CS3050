// functions list, receiving and return types

Create list
receive integer (after finding the largest number in the file)
return initialized empty list

Create Node 
receive full list and 2 integers
receive integers to input to node
return newNode

Add node to list 
call createNode
return head node for list, set nextPtr null

Read file function (if needed)
Make sure not null
return fPtr

Print function
Receive full list
return void

Compare function (for prevNode and curNode
Receive prevNode and curNode
return true or false




1. Read from file

2. Loop through to find the largest value

3. Initialize the first column of the linked list (adjacency list)

4. Vertice pairs w/ edges

5. 1 to n pairs

6. Create list

7. Add node

8. Initialize a curNode and prevNode to track sizes

9. if() to compare and check increasing order with values of curNode and prevNode

10. Check to ensure pair does not repeat
